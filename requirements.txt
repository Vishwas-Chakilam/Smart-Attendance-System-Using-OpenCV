configparser
Explanation of Requirements
  1. opencv-python: Provides OpenCV bindings for Python. Used for accessing the webcam and performing basic image processing tasks.
  2. face-recognition: A simple face recognition library that wraps around dlib, making it easier to use face recognition algorithms.
  3. numpy: A fundamental package for numerical computations in Python. Used here for handling array operations.
  4. Pillow: The Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork. Used for image processing tasks, such as converting OpenCV images to a format suitable for Tkinter.
  5. tk: Tkinter is Pythonâ€™s de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package.
  6. configparser: A module used to handle configuration files (config.ini).
