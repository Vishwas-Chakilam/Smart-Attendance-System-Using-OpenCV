### `config.ini` Example

```ini
[Paths]
KNOWN_FACES_DIR = known_faces
ATTENDANCE_CSV_PATH = attendance.csv

[Camera]
CAMERA_INDEX = 0  # Default camera. Change this to 1, 2, etc., for other cameras

[Security]
PASSWORD = yourpassword  # Replace 'yourpassword' with a strong password
```

### Explanation of `config.ini` Sections

1. **[Paths]**
   - **KNOWN_FACES_DIR**: Specifies the directory where known faces images are stored. This should match the folder where you have stored the images of the people you want to recognize.
   - **ATTENDANCE_CSV_PATH**: The path to the CSV file where attendance records will be saved.

2. **[Camera]**
   - **CAMERA_INDEX**: Specifies which camera to use for capturing video. The default value `0` typically refers to the built-in camera of a laptop or the first camera connected. You can change this to `1`, `2`, etc., if you have multiple cameras connected to your computer.

3. **[Security]**
   - **PASSWORD**: Allows you to set a password for accessing the attendance system, adding a layer of security. Replace `'yourpassword'` with a strong, unique password.

### How to Use `config.ini`

1. **Modify the Configurations**: Open `config.ini` in a text editor and modify the paths, camera index, and password as needed for your environment.
2. **Apply the Configurations**: When you run the `attendance_system.py` script, it will read these settings from the `config.ini` file and apply them accordingly.

Ensure that `config.ini` is located in the root directory of your project so that the script can find and read it properly.
